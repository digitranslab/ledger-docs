# Bad debt

Bad debt refers to the amount of money owed to a customer that is unlikely to be repaid by the debtor. It arises when a borrower defaults on their payment obligations, typically due to financial hardship or unwillingness to pay.

Bad debts can have a negative impact on a company's financial health and may require write-offs or collection efforts to recover partial or full amounts.

When invoices you send become uncollectible, you need to record them as a bad debt and write them off.
