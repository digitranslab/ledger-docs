# Landed cost

The landed cost allows you to include additional costs (shipment, insurance, customs duties, etc.) into the original cost of the product to help you track the product cost more accurately.

#### Step 1: Create a bill and landed cost

- Create a new bill
- Add landed cost by creating a new expense transaction or bill, if the landed cost is payable on specific vendor.
- Mark the expense items that you want to allocate them to the original bill as **Landed cost**.
